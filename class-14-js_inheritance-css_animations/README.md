## Lecture 14

## Today's Schedule
- Notes:
    - Anything top of mind?

- Final Project Notes:
    - The Code 301 entrance test will be assigned in Canvas tmrw *Friday* and must be submitted by *Sunday @11:59pm*. This applies to ALL students, regardless of your plans for 301, as it is part of your final grade in 201.
    - The passing score on the test is 80%. If you do not pass on the first try, I will be in touch with you on Monday about retaking it (allowed once) next Wednesday, so keep studying!
    - All late assignments and resubmits must also be completed by *Sunday DATE 11:59pm* in Canvas. You need a 90% or above in the course to pass and be eligible to move forward to Code 301.
    - Enrollment for Code 301 will take place the week after Code 201 ends (I’ll send more details next week).

    - Project Pitches & Plan for next week

- Code Review
- JS Topics
- Lab Preview


**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Lecture 14 of Code 201, students will:
- Be able to demonstrate understanding of JavaScript inheritance, as measured by a quiz administered in Canvas and the Code 301 entrance exam.
- Be able to integrate CSS animations into a code project, measured through inclusion in this week’s project or the final project.
